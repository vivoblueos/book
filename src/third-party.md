# Add third party crates

We manage all third party crates in the https://github.com/vivoblueos/external repository.
All crates are transformed into GN's `BUILD.gn` files via [gnrt](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/tools/crates/gnrt/) which is initially created by the Chromium project.

## Add dependency in `//external/Cargo.toml`
To add a new third party crate, for example, [unwinding](https://crates.io/crates/unwinding). Add following code in `//external/Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies.unwinding]
version = "=0.2.4"
default-features = false
features = [
    "unwinder"
]
```
Then run `ninja -C <out> run_gnrt`.
After the above two steps, developers can add `//external/vendor/unwinding-0.2.4:unwinding` to the `deps` field in the target defintions in `BUILD.gn`.
